# Duck Game - Improved Setup

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. **Sprite Scaling System**
- **Problem**: All sprites were being scaled to 64x64 pixels, making large sprites pixelated and small sprites blurry
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent scaling based on sprite dimensions:
  - Duck (99x95): Scaled to 0.4x for reasonable character size
  - Rock (18x63): Scaled to 1.5x to make it more visible
  - Bear (440x567): Scaled to 0.08x to fit game proportions
  - Tornado (400x624): Scaled to 0.1x for appropriate obstacle size
  - Large collectibles (500x500): Scaled to 0.06x for pickup-sized items
  - Ground/Grass tiles: Scaled to 32x32 for better platforming precision

### 2. **Tile System Improvements**
- **Changed tile size from 64 to 32 pixels** for better game precision
- **Updated camera bounds** to work with new tile system
- **Improved rendering culling** for better performance
- **Proper ground level calculation** (18 tiles * 32 pixels = 576)

### 3. **Duck Positioning**
- **Fixed starting position**: Duck now starts at proper ground level (576 - 20 pixels)
- **Adjusted gravity system** to work with new tile proportions
- **Proper collision bounds** with scaled sprite system

### 4. **Level Design**
- **Created appealing platformer level** with:
  - Multiple terrain layers using grass (G) and ground (#) tiles
  - Strategic placement of platforms for jumping gameplay
  - Varied elevation changes for interesting traversal
  - Proper spacing between obstacles and collectibles

### 5. **Entity Types & Placement**
- **Ground tiles (#)**: Base terrain and solid platforms
- **Grass tiles (G)**: Decorative terrain on top of ground
- **Obstacles**: 
  - Rocks (R): Small jumping obstacles
  - Puddles (P): Ground hazards
  - Tornados (T): Large moving obstacles
- **Collectibles**:
  - Feathers (F): Jump boost items
  - Seeds (S): Points/health items  
  - Juice (J): Speed boost items
- **Enemies**:
  - Bears (B): Ground enemies to avoid

## Game Features Ready for Implementation

### Movement System
- ✅ Left/Right movement with arrow keys
- ✅ Jumping with spacebar
- ✅ Gravity and ground collision
- ✅ Proper sprite scaling and positioning

### Visual System
- ✅ Smooth camera following
- ✅ Frustum culling for performance

## Next Steps for Gameplay Implementation

1. **Collision Detection**: Implement proper tile-based collision
2. **Collectible Effects**: Add functionality to feathers, seeds, juice
3. **Enemy Behavior**: Add bear movement and collision damage
4. **Obstacle Interactions**: Tornado pushing, puddle slowing
5. **Game States**: Add start screen, game over, scoring
6. **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback
7. **Animations**: Add sprite animations for duck and enemies

## Technical Notes

- All sprites now scale appropriately based on their original dimensions
- Tile system uses 32x32 pixel grid for precise platforming
- Camera smoothly follows duck with proper world bounds
- Memory management handles up to 3000 tiles, 100 obstacles, 100 collectibles, 50 enemies
- Rendering is optimized with frustum culling

The game now has a proper foundation that looks like a real platformer game, with the duck properly positioned on the ground and obstacles/collectibles at appropriate sizes and locations.
